## Project Architecture & Setup (COMPLETED ✅)

### What Was Built
- Next.js 14 app with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- Database schema with migrations (Supabase)
- State management (Zustand stores)
- Custom hooks pattern for data fetching
- Menu & Cart components

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, React 19, TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4
- **State**: Zustand (^5.0.8)
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Data Fetching**: Custom hooks (useMenu, useSubmitOrder, useTableInfo)

### Challenges & Solutions
- **Challenge**: Keep components clean without Supabase everywhere
- **Solution**: Custom hooks pattern - logic separated from UI

- **Challenge**: Cart needs persistence
- **Solution**: Zustand with persist middleware (localStorage)

- **Challenge**: Choose rendering strategy
- **Solution**: Client-side only for cost optimization

### Lessons Learned
- ✅ Custom hooks > TanStack Query for simple use cases
- ✅ Zustand perfect for cart with persistence
- ✅ Client-side cheaper and simpler when no SEO needed
- ✅ Direct Supabase = lower latency

### Follow-up Items
- [ ] Customer ordering page
- [ ] OrderConfirmation component
- [ ] Admin dashboard
- [ ] QR code generation
- [ ] Add Supabase type generation
- [ ] Global error boundary
